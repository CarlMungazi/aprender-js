## Aprender

### What Is This?

A project similar to [this](https://github.com/taniarascia/laconia). They say one of the best ways is to learn is by doing. Well, this is just that. There are so many tools used in frontend development and this is my attempt at learning some of them from a first principles approach. I have built a basic, non-production ready, version of various parts of the frontend stack and documented the lessons learned in the process.
